# Smart Contract Deployment

Anyone can build a smart contract application on the Staco Chain Mainnet or Testnet network. below is step by step walkthrough on how to deploy a simple smart contract counter using Remix. 

Note: Before you start deploying using Remix, make sure you are connected Staco Mainnet / Testnet in your metamask. See the Connect a Chain section for details. 

## What is Remix? 

Remix is open-source Ethereum IDE you can use to write, compile and debug Solidity code. As such, Remix can be a hugely important tool in Web3 and dApps development/ 

you can jump to the Remix text editor [Here](https://remix.ethereum.org) and copy paste this code below. 

```solidity filename="counter.sol" copy
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT 

pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

contract TestStacoSimpleCounter {
    int private count = 0;
    function incrementCounter() public {
        count += 1;
    }

    function decrementCounter() public {
        count -= 1;
    }

    function getCount() public view returns (int) {
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Compile Code

After the code is written, compile it using Solidity version based on the code written. Once the code is compiled, a green Check will be shown. it is ready to be deployed on the Staco Blockchain. Click the Deploy button and a Metamask window will show pop up. 

## Smart Contract Ready

After the smartcontract is deployed, the contract address can be seen and you can interact. you can verify your contract on Explorer Staco Mainnet.
