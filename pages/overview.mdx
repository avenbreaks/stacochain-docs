# Protocol Overview

Staco Chain, a Layer 1 blockchain built with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and an identical consensus mechanism to Ethereum. Our goal is to provide a seamless and efficient blockchain environment that maintains the decentralization, security, and flexibility of the Ethereum network while offering a dedicated infrastructure for developers and users.

## Ethereum-Compatible Infrastructure

Staco blockchain is identical to Ethereum in terms of its core architecture, consensus mechanism, and execution environment. It supports the same consensus algorithm, ensuring full compatibility with existing Ethereum-based tools, wallets, and smart contract deployments.
