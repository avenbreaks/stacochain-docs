## Getting Started Developing for Chain Mainnet

This guide explains the basics of Chain Mainnet development. Chain Mainnet is EVM equivalent, meaning we run a slightly modified version of the same geth you run on mainnet. Therefore, the differences between Chain Mainnet development and Ethereum development are minor. But a few differences do exist.

### Interacting on Chain Mainnet or Staco Chain

As you can see in the different development stacks below, the way you deploy contracts and interact with them on Chain Mainnet or Chain Testnet is almost identical to the way you do it with L1 Ethereum.
The most visible difference is that you have to specify a different endpoint (of course).
The list of other differences.
