# Ethereum JSON RPC Methods
The execution engine's RPC interface is identical to the upstream [Geth RPC interface.](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server) The responses are nearly identical too, except we also include the L1 gas usage and price information.

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain network with Turing-complete smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency. As of mid-September 2022, Ethereum uses the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.

### RPC Methods
This section provides instructions on how to use JSON-RPC API on the Ethereum (execution layer) network. 

### Error Codes
The following list contains all possible error codes and associated messages:

Example call eth_blockNumber

```bash filename="shell" copy
curl https://rpc-mainnet.cybria.io	 \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params": [],"id":1}' | jq
```

Response 

```bash filename="shell" copy
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0x65a8db"
}
```
