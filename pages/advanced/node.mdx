# Node Operator Overview
The Node Operator section of the Staco Docs is a collection of guides and tutorials to help you run your own Staco Mainnet nodes. If you'd like to learn more about how Staco Mainnet works under the hood, refer to the Staco Mainnet Getting Started Guide. If you want to get right into running a node, you can skip ahead to the Node Operator Tutorials section.

# Execution Client
The Execution Client is responsible for processing and validating block payloads within the Staco Mainnet. It exposes the standard Ethereum-compatible JSON-RPC API, which developers can use to query blockchain data and submit transactions to the network. In essence, the Execution Client serves the same purpose as an execution client in Ethereum, but within the context of Stacoâ€™s Layer 1 PoA consensus model.

# Software Releases
It is essential to keep your node software up to date to remain in sync with the rest of the Staco Mainnet. Updates may include critical consensus improvements, security patches, and performance optimizations to ensure that your node stays reliable and secure.

Tip before running in Linux:
If synchronizing to Mainnet on Linux or other chains with large data requirements, increase the maximum number of open files allowed using ulimit. If the open files limit is not high enough, a Too many open files RocksDB exception occurs.

## Get Started

Staco Mainnet Genesis File: <br/>
[TBA](https://stacochain.com) <br/>
[TBA](https://stacochain.com)

#### Create Directory

```bash filename="shell" copy
mkdir staco_node
cd staco_node
wget https://stacochain.com/mainnetgenesis.json
```

Create a staco_config.toml with the following options:

```toml filename="shell" copy showLineNumbers
# Enode Pointing
bootnodes=["<Mainnet_Gateway_Bootnodes>"]

# Staco Genesis File
genesis-file="[PATH]/mainnetgenesis.json"

# Data directory
data-path="[PATH]/staco_node

# Chain Configuration 
rpc-http-enabled=true
rpc-ws-enabled=true
host-allowlist=["*"]
sync-mode=["FULL"]
rpc-http-host=[IPHOST]
rpc-ws-host=[IPHOST]
rpc-http-cors-origins=["all"]

# API Method
rpc-http-api=["ETH","NET","WEB3"]
rpc-ws-api=["ETH","NET","WEB3"]
```

#### List Bootnodes : 

```bash filename="shell" copy showLineNumbers
Enode Will Be Updated Soon
Enode Will Be Updated Soon
Enode Will Be Updated Soon
```

#### Start Node

```bash filename="shell" copy
geth --config-file=chain_config.toml
```

Run in a Service System

```bash filename="shell" copy
nano /etc/systemd/system/stacochain.service
```

```bash filename="shell" copy
[Unit]
Description=Staco Node

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Restart=always
ExecStart=[PATH]/besu --config-file=[PATH]/chain_config.toml 

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Confirm Staco Node is Running

```
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_gasPrice","params":[],"id":53}' http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

Response:

```bash filename="shell" copy
{
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
  "id" : 53,
  "result" : "0x3e8"
}
```
