# Layers

As blockchain technology evolves, the need for Ethereum-compatible networks continues to grow.  
Our blockchain enables developers, businesses, and users to benefit from the vast ecosystem of Ethereum without dealing with congestion or high transaction fees.  

By mirroring Ethereum’s architecture, we ensure:

- **Full EVM Support** – Deploy smart contracts, dApps, and tokens (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.) just as you would on Ethereum.
- **Identical Consensus Mechanism** – Our blockchain employs the same consensus model as Ethereum, ensuring decentralization and security.
- **Seamless Interoperability** – Compatible with Metamask, Web3.js, Hardhat, Truffle, and other Ethereum tools.
- **Scalability & Customization** – While maintaining Ethereum’s architecture, our network allows for tailored optimizations and governance.


### Core Features

- **Proof Of Stake Consensus** – The network utilizes Ethereum’s well-established consensus algorithm, providing trust and reliability.  
- **Smart Contract Execution** – Write and deploy smart contracts using Solidity without any modifications.  
- **Native Token & Gas Fees** – Transactions and contract executions require gas fees, similar to Ethereum, ensuring network integrity.  
- **Developer-Friendly Environment** – Familiar tools, frameworks, and libraries allow for quick and efficient development.  
- **Secure & Decentralized** – By leveraging Ethereum’s security model, we ensure resistance to attacks and maintain network robustness.  

### Who Can Benefit from This Blockchain?

- **Developers** – Easily migrate existing Ethereum projects without rewriting code.  
- **Businesses & Enterprises** – Build secure and transparent apps leveraging blockchain technology.  
- **Crypto Enthusiasts** – Engage in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and more within a familiar ecosystem.
