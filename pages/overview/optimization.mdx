## Execution Layer

### Introduction
The Staco Chain Execution Layer is responsible for processing transactions, executing smart contracts, and maintaining the state of the blockchain. As a fully Staco Virtual Machine (SVM) Layer 1 blockchain, Staco Chain follows the same execution model as Ethereum, ensuring compatibility with existing Ethereum-based tools and applications.

### Overview of the Execution Layer
ðŸ”¹ The Execution Layer is a crucial component of Staco Chain, responsible for handling:
ðŸ”¹ Transaction Processing â€“ Validating and executing user transactions.
ðŸ”¹ Smart Contract Execution â€“ Running decentralized applications (dApps) and executing Solidity-based smart contracts.
ðŸ”¹ State Management â€“ Updating account balances, contract storage, and network state after transaction execution.
ðŸ”¹ EVM Compatibility â€“ Ensuring seamless interaction with Ethereum-based wallets, tools, and protocols.

### Core Components of the Execution Layer
- Staco Virtual Machine (DVM)
Executes smart contracts and processes transactions within the Staco Chain network.
Fully compatible with Solidity, Vyper, and other Ethereum-based development languages.
- Transactions & Gas Fees
Transactions require gas fees, similar to Ethereum, to prevent spam and allocate network resources efficiently.
Gas fees are paid in the native token of Staco Chain.
- Smart Contract Execution
Developers can deploy and interact with smart contracts using Ethereum-standard tools like Remix, Hardhat, Truffle, and Web3.js.
Supports ERC-20, ERC-721, and other Ethereum token standards.
- State Management
The Execution Layer updates the blockchain state by processing transactions and storing contract states.
Utilizes Merkle Patricia Tries for efficient storage and retrieval of account data.
- Interoperability
Staco Chainâ€™s Execution Layer is designed for seamless integration with existing Ethereum infrastructure.
Supports Ethereumâ€™s JSON-RPC API, allowing easy interaction with wallets like Metamask, Trust Wallet, and other.

### How the Execution Layer Works
- Transaction Submission â€“ Users submit transactions through wallets or dApps.
- Transaction Validation â€“ Transactions are verified by the networkâ€™s nodes.
- Execution in the EVM â€“ The smart contract code is executed within the EVM environment.
- State Update â€“ The blockchain state is updated based on the execution results.
- Block Finalization â€“ Valid transactions are added to new blocks and propagated across the network.

### Developer Tools & Integration
To build on Staco Chain, developers can use:
- Solidity & Vyper for smart contract development.
- Truffle & Hardhat for contract deployment and testing.
- Web3.js & Ethers.js for blockchain interactions.
- Metamask & WalletConnect for user authentication and transactions.
