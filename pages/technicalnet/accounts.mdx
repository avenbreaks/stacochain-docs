# Accounts
An Staco account is an entity with an ether (STACO) balance that can send transactions on Staco. Accounts can be user-controlled or deployed as smart contracts.

## Account types
Staco has two account types:
- Externally-owned account (EOA) – controlled by anyone with the private keys
- Contract account – a smart contract deployed to the network, controlled by code. 

Both account types have the ability to:
- Receive, hold and send STACO and tokens
- Interact with deployed smart contracts
